# Containerized App Exercise

Build a containerized app that uses machine learning. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.

## Description

The ASL interpreter app uses machine learning to recognize American Sign Language gestures from a live video feed, providing real-time translations into text output.
Designed for accessibility and ease of use, it offers a seamless, containerized experience that runs across three subsystems: gesture recognition, a web interface, and a database.
